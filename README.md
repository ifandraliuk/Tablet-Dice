# Welcome to the Tablet & Dice! 
 Step into an exciting world of adventure with Tablet&Dice! Create your own character and customize it to your liking with a variety of species, abilities, and talents. Take on daring quests and battles with the help of your ever-faithful companion. As you progress, upgrade your gear and track your story in the diary to keep all the details safe. It's time to embark on an unforgettable adventure with Tablet&Dice!

# Main idea
In this project I'm going to digitilize a simplified version of a [Pen & Paper] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) game. Spend quality time with friends, make memories and get creative with Tablet&Dice. This app helps you organize your campaigns, keep track of all your adventures, and share it with your friends in a secure and easy-to-use platform. Never worry about forgetting details or searching for notes again. 
## Main features of the project:
* Create a unique character
* Level up system, talents and abilities 
* Diary with sharing & editing features. Forget all those papers gone missing by the last game session. Now you have everything safe and sorted in the app!
* Inventory with huge item database. Enchant, equip your gear. Loot everything in your adventure and simply add it in your inventory instead of writing it on a paper. Enjoy playfull and colorfull items you found. Collect set items and get unique set bonuses!

## Goals:
* Companions and taming system. Enjoy exploring the world and have fun not only by taming creatures, but by equipping and leveling it. 
* Additional inventory functionality. Craft potions or equipment, destroy elements etc. 
* Battle system: save initiative role for the fight, add enemies as a gamemaster and keep tracking about the battle in battellog.
* Campaigns: start your adventure in one of the epic world events. Join a bad or good campaign with lore description and strategy.
